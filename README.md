This project is my introduction to Test-Driven Development. Initially, the emphasis on logic implementation and testing before UI development felt intimidating. However, as I progresed, it not only made me more comfortable with TDD but also significantly honed my logic-building and problem-solving skills along with refining my skills with React.
Some of the challenges, aside from learning Jest, included using object-oriented paradigm specifically Factory function pattern alongside of React state-management good practices. Also implementing Drag and Drop functionality from scratch was challenging.

# Need to add:

- Multiplayer functionality 
- Better UI
- Better Bot
- Add responsiveness
- Integrate [RTL](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

# Crafted with:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

- [Guide Setting Up Jest and RTL with Next.js](https://github.com/PrassesKhadka/next-testing)
